# Better Lock

A custom lock screen service for Omarchy, cloned from the built-in `omarchy.lock`.

## Features

From the built-in `omarchy.lock`:

- Password and fingerprint PAM authentication with session lock handling

New in this clone:

- Big customizable date and time display above the password input field
- Power action controls at the bottom for Shutdown, Restart, and Sleep
- Integrated MPRIS media widget showing currently playing track title, artist, and playback controls (previous, play/pause, next)
- Security prompt for "Forgot password" that alerts and blanks the screen
- Separate password and fingerprint PAM authentication flows
- Full keyboard navigation across every control

## Requirements

- Omarchy quattro

## Install

This is a personal clone of the built-in `omarchy.lock`; on this machine it lives in the shell plugin monorepo and is installed under the id `bibek.lock`. To install from the standalone repo on a fresh system:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/BibekBhusal0/omarchy-better-lock.git --enable
```

## Configuration

Options live in `~/.config/omarchy/lock.json` (watched live, so edits apply instantly):

```json
{
  "timeFormat": "hh:mm AP",
  "dateFormat": "dddd, MMMM d"
}
```

Set `autoSuspend` and `suspendTimer` on the plugin entry in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` to suspend the computer after it has been locked
for a number of seconds. `autoSuspend: false` (the default) keeps the lock
screen visible without suspending. `suspendTimer: 0` suspends immediately when
automatic suspend is enabled:

```json
{
  "id": "bibek.lock",
  "autoSuspend": false,
  "suspendTimer": 300
}
```

## Uninstall

```bash
omarchy plugin remove bibek.lock
```
